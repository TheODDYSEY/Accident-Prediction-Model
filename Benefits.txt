Benefit for Underdeveloped Countries:

Resource Allocation: By using this model, authorities can allocate resources more effectively to areas with a higher predicted accident severity. This allows for targeted interventions and improved road safety.

Planning and Mitigation: Planners and decision-makers can take proactive measures to mitigate the risk of accidents. They can plan for safety improvements, such as road infrastructure enhancements, traffic enforcement, and educational programs.

Data-Driven Decision Making: In underdeveloped countries, where resources may be limited, using data-driven models like this helps prioritize safety initiatives and make the most of available resources.

Monitoring Trends: While accidents are inherently unpredictable, the model helps in monitoring trends and making informed decisions to reduce accident rates over time.
